**Banker's Algorithm in C++**

This project implements the Banker's Algorithm, a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm commonly used in operating systems. It reads information about processes, resources, and their allocations from an input file and determines if a safe sequence exists to avoid deadlocks.

**Project Structure**

**Source Code**: project2_operatingsystems.c
**Input File**: input.txt

**How It Works**

The program reads the following from `input.txt`:
1. Number of processes and resources.
2. Current allocation of resources to each process.
3. Maximum resource needs for each process.
4. Available resources.

The program then uses the Banker's Algorithm to calculate whether there is a sequence of processes that can execute to completion without causing a deadlock.

## Usage

### Input File Format

The `input.txt` file should be structured as follows:
1. The first line contains the number of processes and the number of resources.
2. The following lines provide the allocation matrix, where each row represents the resources currently allocated to a process.
3. The next set of lines represents the maximum resources needed for each process.
4. The final line provides the available resources.

Example `input.txt`:
5 3 0 1 0 2 0 0 3 0 2 2 1 1 0 0 2 7 5 3 3 2 2 9 0 2 2 2 2 4 3 3 3 3 2

To compile the code, use a C++ compiler like g++: g++ project2_operatingsystems.c - o bankers
To run the compiled code: ./bankers
Example Output

The output will display a safe sequence if one exists or indicate that the sequence is unsafe:
